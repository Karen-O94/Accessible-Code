# Accessible-Code
Horiseon is a leading marketing agency with the singular aim to assist businesses with developing and implementing the best marketing strategies to attract more clients.

 The aim of this project was to refractor the codebase of the Horiseon webpage. We had to ensure the codebase followed best practices and  the webpage met the accessibility standards to ensure their site was optimised for search engines.
